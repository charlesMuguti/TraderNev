            <p>
              We believe that quality trading education should be accessible to everyone. 
              TraderMap focuses on connecting traders with free, high-quality resources rather 
              than promoting paid courses or services.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              All educators and resources listed on TraderMap have been selected based on the quality 
              of their content, clarity of instruction, and community reputation.
            </p>
